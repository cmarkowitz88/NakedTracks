        <p><strong>About Master Tracks:</strong> Master Tracks is a tribute to the artists, songwriters, musicians, producers, and engineers who have defined and shaped the music industry since multitrack recording was first invented in the late 1950's. This collection of tracks has inspired thousands of musicians to pick up instruments in an attempt to try to emulate these inspirational musical performances.</p>
        
          <p>There is a certain magic that happens when a group of gifted musicians sit down and play together in a recording studio. There's also a certain magic that happens when each musician's individual part weaves its way into the aural tapestry of the completed song. While a certain part may not seem all the special by itself, when it's mixed together with the other instruments they begin to take on a life of their own. The instrumental parts often sound different to the listener when they are mixed together to create the final mix. That's what this game is all about, isolating and listening those special musical performances.</p>
        
        <p>We've tried to compile some of the greatest instrumental performances from Motown to Heavy Metal. This is by no means an exahustive list and we hope to continue adding additional tracks. We challenge you to use your mind and ears to try and identify these tracks as they would hopefully sound as if you were sitting in a recording studio listening back to the isolated tracks. Our goal is to take you on a musical journey and make you feel like you're sitting in the producer's chair.</p>
        
        <p>These tracks are not intended to be an exact replica of the actual performances, as that would be pratcically impossible on just about every level. Instead these tracks are intended to be a guide and recognizable enough to be identifed for the entertainment purposes of this game. We hope you enjoy the musical journey and thank all of our fellow musicians; past, present, and future for their inspirational musical vision.</p>
